status: ready
---

This component library for Veterans Affairs is intended to encourage consistent, usable, and accessible design principles as well as implement well known UI standards into the current VA Mobile Application ecosystem. These elements and components provide a starting point for developing VA applications. You can browse through these components using the navigation on the left side panel.

Before getting started on any component development, it is recommended that you read through the [Fractal documentation](http://fractal.build/guide) to get familiar with the UI that runs this library.
